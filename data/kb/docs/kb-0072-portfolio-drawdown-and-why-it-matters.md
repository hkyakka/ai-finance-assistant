# Understanding Portfolio Drawdown and Its Importance

**Summary:** Portfolio drawdown shows the largest loss from a peak to a trough over a period. Monitoring drawdowns helps assess investment risk and the time needed for recovery.

## Key ideas
- Drawdown is the percentage drop from the highest value to the lowest point before recovery.
- It measures downside risk and volatility in a portfolio.
- A bigger drawdown requires a larger gain to get back to the peak value.
- Drawdowns differ from losses, as they focus on falling from a high point, not from the purchase price.
- Investors use drawdowns to compare fund risks and to plan withdrawals carefully.

## Simple example
If an investment reaches $20,000 but falls to $18,000 before climbing back, the drawdown is 10%. This shows the portfolio lost 10% from its peak before recovering.
