# Primary Market vs Secondary Market (IPO vs Trading)

**Summary:** The primary market is where companies first sell new stocks or bonds to raise money, like in an IPO. The secondary market is where investors buy and sell these securities among themselves after the initial sale.

## Key ideas
- Primary market involves issuing new securities directly from companies.
- IPO (Initial Public Offering) is a key event in the primary market.
- Secondary market includes stock exchanges where investors trade existing securities.
- Money from the primary market sale goes to the company; secondary market trades do not.
- Securities usually cost less in the primary market before trading begins.
- Strict regulations apply during primary market offerings.

## Simple example
A startup issues 1,000 shares at $10 each in an IPO, raising $10,000 for itself in the primary market. After the IPO, investors buy and sell these shares on the secondary market, where the price can change based on demand, for example, rising to $12 per share.
