# Risk vs Return: Why Higher Return Requires Higher Risk

**Summary:** Investing follows a key principle: to earn higher returns, you must accept higher risk. Lower-risk investments offer more safety but generally provide smaller profits. Understanding this balance helps investors make smarter choices based on their goals and comfort with risk.

## Key ideas
- Higher potential returns come with a greater chance of loss.
- Low-risk investments are safer but usually yield lower profits.
- Risk tolerance varies by individual and influences investment choices.
- Diversifying investments can help manage overall risk.
- Investment time frame affects how much risk can be taken.
- Evaluating risk-return tradeoff is essential for portfolios and single investments.

## Simple example
If you invest $1,000 in a low-risk bond that gives 3% yearly return, you earn $30 after one year. But if you put the same amount in stocks with higher risk, the return could be 10% ($100) or you could lose money. Accepting this risk may lead to bigger rewards over time.
