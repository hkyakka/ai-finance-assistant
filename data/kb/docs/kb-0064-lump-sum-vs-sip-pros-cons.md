# Lump Sum vs SIP: Pros and Cons

**Summary:** Lump sum investing means putting a big amount at once while SIP spreads investments regularly. Each has advantages and risks depending on market conditions and personal preferences.

## Key ideas
- Lump sum can yield higher returns if markets rise soon after investment.
- SIP reduces risk by investing smaller amounts over time, averaging market price.
- Lump sum is risky in volatile markets as timing matters more.
- SIP helps build disciplined investing habits and suits steady income.
- Choosing depends on risk tolerance, market view, and cash availability.

## Simple example
If you invest ₹1,00,000 as a lump sum and the market grows 12% yearly, your amount grows faster. Alternatively, investing ₹8,333 monthly as SIP (total ₹1,00,000 in a year) averages market ups and downs, reducing risk of a bad entry point.
