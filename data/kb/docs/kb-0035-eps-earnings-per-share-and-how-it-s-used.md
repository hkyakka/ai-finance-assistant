# Understanding EPS and Its Uses

**Summary:** Earnings per share (EPS) shows how much profit a company earns for each share of common stock. It’s a key measure to assess profitability and compare companies. Different types of EPS help investors understand core earnings, cash earnings, and retained profits.

## Key ideas
- EPS = Net income ÷ Number of common shares outstanding.
- Higher EPS generally means better profitability and can increase stock value.
- Different EPS forms include reported (GAAP), ongoing (pro forma), cash, retained, and book value EPS.
- Ongoing EPS excludes one-time events, showing earnings from regular business operations.
- EPS helps compare companies within the same industry or track performance over time.

## Simple example
If a company earns $1,000,000 in net income and has 500,000 shares outstanding, its EPS is $2. This means each share earned $2 in profit during that period.
