# Understanding the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

**Summary:** The P/E ratio shows how much investors pay for each dollar of a company’s earnings. It helps evaluate if a stock is overvalued or undervalued but should be used carefully. Different accounting methods and sector differences can make P/E ratios misleading if used alone.

## Key ideas
- P/E ratio = Stock price ÷ Earnings per share (EPS).
- A high P/E may indicate expected future growth, not just overvaluation.
- Compare P/E only within the same industry for accuracy.
- Earnings used in the ratio can be based on past or forecasted data.
- Use P/E alongside other metrics for better investment decisions.

## Simple example
If a stock costs $50 per share and its EPS is $5, the P/E ratio is 10. This means investors pay $10 for every $1 of earnings the company makes.
