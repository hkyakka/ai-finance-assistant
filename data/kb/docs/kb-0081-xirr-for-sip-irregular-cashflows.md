# Understanding XIRR for Irregular Cashflows in SIPs

**Summary:** XIRR calculates the annualized return for investments with uneven cash flows and dates. It's ideal for SIPs where contributions and withdrawals happen on different days. This helps track true investment performance considering time value of money.

## Key ideas
- XIRR finds the internal rate of return for cash flows happening at irregular intervals.
- Unlike regular IRR, XIRR uses exact dates of each cash inflow and outflow.
- Ideal for SIPs because investments are made periodically but not on fixed dates.
- Considers the timing and amount of each cash flow to compute accurate returns.
- Helps compare returns from investments with varying contribution schedules.
- Useful tool in Excel and Google Sheets for financial analysis.

## Simple example
Imagine you invest ₹10,000 on Jan 1, ₹15,000 on Mar 1, and sell for ₹30,000 on Dec 31. Using XIRR with these dates and cash flows gives the true annual return, accounting for when the money was invested and received.
