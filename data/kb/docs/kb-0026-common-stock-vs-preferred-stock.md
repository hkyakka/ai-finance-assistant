# Common Stock vs Preferred Stock

**Summary:** Common and preferred stocks both represent ownership in a company but differ in rights and risks. Preferred stockholders get fixed dividends and priority in payouts, while common stockholders usually have voting rights and potential for higher returns.

## Key ideas
- Preferred stock pays fixed dividends before common stock dividends.
- Preferred shareholders are paid first if a company is liquidated.
- Common stockholders usually have voting rights; preferred stockholders usually do not.
- Common stock is more volatile but can offer higher long-term gains.
- Preferred stock value is less affected by market changes and is often callable.

## Simple example
If a company pays $5,000 total dividends, preferred shareholders with fixed claims get paid first, say $3,000, then the remaining $2,000 goes to common shareholders. If the company liquidates with $100,000 left, preferred shareholders get paid before common shareholders.
