# Anchoring Bias in Investing

**Summary:** Anchoring bias happens when investors fixate on the original purchase price of a stock, affecting their decisions. This can lead to missed opportunities or holding losing investments in hope of a price rebound.

## Key ideas
- Investors mentally 'anchor' to the price they first saw or paid.
- This bias can prevent them from buying at slightly higher prices.
- Anchoring may cause holding stocks that have dropped in value.
- It is a common cognitive bias in trading and investing decisions.
- Adjustments to the anchor price are often insufficient or biased.

## Simple example
Suppose you want to buy a stock priced at $270, but it rises to $290 or $310. You wait for it to drop back to $270, but it never does. By sticking to this anchor price, you miss buying the stock, which later grows much higher.
