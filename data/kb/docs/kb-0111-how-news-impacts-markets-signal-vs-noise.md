# How News Influences Markets: Signal vs Noise

**Summary:** Market prices move based on new information, but not all news affects value equally. True signals reflect real economic changes, while noise consists of random or misleading short-term fluctuations.

## Key ideas
- Signals are meaningful news that impacts market trends and company value.
- Noise includes short-term price swings or irrelevant info that confuses investors.
- Distinguishing signal from noise is harder over short time frames.
- Longer-term perspective helps filter out noise and focus on real trends.
- Noise often arises from program trading, rumors, or temporary events.
- Investors must be cautious not to react too quickly to market noise.

## Simple example
Suppose a company’s stock jumps 5% in one day after a new product announcement (signal). However, on the same day, the stock also moves up and down by 1-2% several times due to random trades (noise). Over a few months, the stock stabilizes higher, confirming the product news was a true signal.
