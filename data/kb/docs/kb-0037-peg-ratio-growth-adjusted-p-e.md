# Understanding the PEG Ratio

**Summary:** The PEG ratio adjusts the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio by considering a company's expected earnings growth. It gives a clearer picture of a stock’s value by including growth potential.

## Key ideas
- PEG ratio = P/E ratio divided by expected earnings growth rate.
- It helps identify if a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its growth.
- A PEG below 1 often suggests the stock may be undervalued.
- PEG accounts for future growth, unlike the simple P/E ratio.
- Different sources may report different PEGs due to varying growth estimates.
- Best used when comparing companies within the same industry.

## Simple example
If a stock has a P/E ratio of 15 and expected earnings growth of 20% (0.20), the PEG ratio is 15 ÷ 20 = 0.75. Since 0.75 is under 1, the stock might be undervalued considering its growth prospects.
