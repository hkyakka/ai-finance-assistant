# Debt Payoff vs Investing: Which Comes First?

**Summary:** Deciding whether to pay off debt or invest depends on your interest rates and risk tolerance. Generally, paying off high-interest debt is better, but investing can be wiser if expected returns exceed debt costs.

## Key ideas
- Pay off debts with the highest interest rates first to save money on interest.
- Invest if your expected returns are higher than your debt interest rates.
- Consider the risk and volatility of investments before choosing to invest.
- Student loan interest rates and tax benefits can influence whether to pay or invest.
- Personal comfort with financial risk is important in the decision.
- Balancing both paying debt and investing can be effective for some.

## Simple example
If you have $10,000 in credit card debt at 20% interest, paying it off saves you $2,000 a year in interest. But if you have a mortgage at 5% and can invest for a 10% return, investing may grow your money faster.
