# What is a Mutual Fund and How It Works

**Summary:** A mutual fund pools money from many investors to buy a variety of securities, managed by professionals. Investors share profits or losses based on the fund's performance. The fund's price is set daily based on its total value divided by shares outstanding.

## Key ideas
- Mutual funds collect money from many investors to invest together.
- Professional managers choose stocks, bonds, or other assets for the fund.
- The fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) is calculated once daily to set the price.
- Investors earn returns through the fund’s capital gains, dividends, or interest.
- Mutual funds offer diversification, professional management, and lower entry costs.

## Simple example
Imagine a mutual fund with total assets of $50 million and liabilities of $10 million, leaving $40 million net value. If there are 4 million shares, each share’s price (NAV) is $10. An investor buying 100 shares spends $1,000 and benefits if the fund’s assets grow.
