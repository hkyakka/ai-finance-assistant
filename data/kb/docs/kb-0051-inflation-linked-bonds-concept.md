# Inflation-Linked Bonds Explained

**Summary:** Inflation-linked bonds protect investors by adjusting payments based on inflation rates. They help maintain the real value of returns despite rising prices.

## Key ideas
- Interest and principal are tied to inflation indexes like the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- Payments increase with inflation, preserving purchasing power.
- These bonds offer a real yield plus inflation, reducing investment risk.
- Common types include TIPS (US), linkers (UK), and Real Return Bonds (Canada).
- Less volatile than regular bonds and uncorrelated with stocks.
- They may offer limited protection during deflation.

## Simple example
If you buy an inflation-linked bond for $100 with a 4% coupon, and inflation rises by 1.5%, the principal adjusts to $101.50. The interest payment will be 4% of $101.50, or about $4.06, ensuring your return grows with inflation.
