# Risk Capacity vs Risk Tolerance: Key Differences

**Summary:** Risk tolerance is how much risk a person feels comfortable taking emotionally. Risk capacity is the actual financial ability to handle potential losses. Both are important for making smart investment decisions.

## Key ideas
- Risk tolerance reflects emotional comfort with risk.
- Risk capacity shows financial strength to endure losses.
- Tolerance can change with age, experience, and feelings.
- Capacity depends on income, debt, time horizon, and assets.
- Balancing both helps build a suitable investment plan.

## Simple example
Imagine Jane and John both have $10,000 to invest. Jane feels uneasy losing any money (low tolerance), but she has a steady income and savings that can cover losses (high capacity). John is willing to take big risks (high tolerance) but lives paycheck to paycheck with little savings (low capacity). Their investments should reflect these differences.
