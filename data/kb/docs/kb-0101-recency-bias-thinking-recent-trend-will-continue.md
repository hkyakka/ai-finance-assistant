# Recency Bias in Investing

**Summary:** Recency bias is when people believe recent trends or events will keep happening the same way. This often leads to poor financial decisions because investors overweight recent information and ignore long-term probabilities. Understanding this bias helps avoid mistakes like panic selling or buying into bubbles.

## Key ideas
- People give too much importance to recent events, ignoring past data.
- This bias can cause investors to expect a current trend to continue.
- Leads to actions like panic selling during downturns or frenzy buying during booms.
- It distorts the true chance of events happening again soon.
- Being aware of recency bias can improve investment decision-making.

## Simple example
Suppose a stock gained 15% last month. Due to recency bias, an investor might expect the stock to gain another 15% next month, ignoring that such growth is rare and not guaranteed. If they buy more shares just based on recent gains, they risk losses if the trend reverses.
