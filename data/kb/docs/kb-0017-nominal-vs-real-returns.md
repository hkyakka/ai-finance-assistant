# Nominal vs Real Returns

**Summary:** Nominal returns are the stated percentage gains on investments without adjusting for inflation. Real returns show the actual growth in purchasing power by accounting for inflation's impact.

## Key ideas
- Nominal return = real return + inflation rate
- Real return reflects true profit after inflation
- Inflation reduces the value of nominal gains
- Nominal rates are used by banks and central banks
- Real returns help investors understand true investment growth

## Simple example
If you earn 5% nominal interest on a bond but inflation is 3%, your real return is 2%. This means your purchasing power only grows by 2%, not the full 5%.
