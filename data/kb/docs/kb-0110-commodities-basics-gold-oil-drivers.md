# Basics of Gold and Oil Commodity Drivers

**Summary:** Commodities like gold and oil are basic raw materials traded globally. Their prices mainly depend on supply and demand, influenced by economic factors and market behaviors.

## Key ideas
- Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty.
- Oil prices are driven by global supply and demand, with major influence from OPEC production decisions.
- Speculators and hedgers both impact commodity price movements differently.
- Economic growth increases oil demand due to higher fuel and industrial needs.
- Geopolitical events can disrupt supply, causing price volatility.

## Simple example
If OPEC cuts oil supply by 1 million barrels per day during rising demand, oil prices often rise. For example, if oil was $70 per barrel, this reduced supply might push prices to $80 or more. Similarly, when investors fear economic risks, gold prices may rise from $1,900 to $2,000 an ounce as a safe investment.
