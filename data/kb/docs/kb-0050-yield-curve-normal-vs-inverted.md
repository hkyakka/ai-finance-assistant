# Yield Curve: Normal vs Inverted

**Summary:** A yield curve graphs bond yields by maturity, showing interest rates over time. A normal curve slopes upward, signaling economic growth, while an inverted curve slopes downward, often predicting a recession.

## Key ideas
- Normal yield curve: longer bonds have higher yields than shorter bonds.
- Upward slope indicates confidence in future economic growth.
- Inverted yield curve: long-term yields fall below short-term yields.
- Inversion suggests investors expect an economic slowdown or recession.
- Yield curves help forecast interest rates and economic trends.
- Commonly analyzed spreads are between 2-year and 10-year Treasury bonds.

## Simple example
If a 2-year bond yields 1% and a 10-year bond yields 3%, the curve is normal and upward sloping. But if the 2-year bond yields 3% and the 10-year bond yields 1%, the curve is inverted, warning investors of a possible recession.
