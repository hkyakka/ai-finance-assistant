# Risks of Sector and Thematic Funds

**Summary:** Sector and thematic funds focus on specific industries or trends, offering targeted investment opportunities. However, these funds come with higher risks compared to broader market funds due to less diversification and market volatility.

## Key ideas
- Concentrated exposure means higher risk if the sector or theme underperforms.
- Lower diversification increases vulnerability to market swings.
- Thematic funds may suffer from hype cycles and sudden popularity drops.
- Some themes may face liquidity issues, making it hard to buy or sell shares.
- Performance can lag if a trend does not grow as expected or loses investor interest.

## Simple example
Imagine a thematic fund focused on renewable energy. If that sector declines 20% due to regulatory changes, the fund value also drops sharply. If you invested $1,000, your investment could fall to around $800, showing how sector risks impact returns more than a broad market fund.
