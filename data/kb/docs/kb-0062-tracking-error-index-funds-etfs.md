# Tracking Error in Index Funds and ETFs

**Summary:** Tracking error shows how much an ETF or index fund’s performance differs from its target index. Small differences are common due to fees and other factors but large gaps can affect investor returns.

## Key ideas
- Tracking error measures the difference between fund returns and its benchmark index.
- It usually remains small but varies based on fees, taxes, and fund management.
- Causes include fund expenses, trading costs, cash holdings, and security lending.
- High tracking error means the fund doesn’t closely follow the index.
- Investors should check tracking error along with metrics like beta and R-squared.

## Simple example
If an ETF tracking the Nifty 50 index returns 9% in a year while Nifty 50 returns 10%, the tracking error is 1%. This means the ETF underperformed the index by 1 percentage point due to fees or other factors.
