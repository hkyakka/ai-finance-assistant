# SIP Basics: What is a Systematic Investment Plan?

**Summary:** A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a way to invest a fixed amount regularly in mutual funds. It helps build wealth gradually by investing small amounts over time rather than paying a lump sum.

## Key ideas
- SIP involves investing a fixed sum at regular intervals (e.g., monthly).
- It reduces the impact of market volatility through rupee cost averaging.
- SIPs promote disciplined investing and long-term wealth creation.
- You can start SIPs with small amounts, making it affordable for many.
- The invested money is pooled into mutual fund schemes managed by AMCs.

## Simple example
If you invest ₹1000 monthly in a mutual fund SIP for 1 year, you will have invested ₹12,000 in total. Due to market ups and downs, sometimes you buy fewer units, sometimes more, but it averages out and can help grow your investment steadily.
