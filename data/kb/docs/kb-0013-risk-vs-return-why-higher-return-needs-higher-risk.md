# Risk vs Return: Why Higher Return Means Higher Risk

**Summary:** In investing, to earn higher returns, you must accept higher risks. Lower risks usually lead to smaller gains, while bigger rewards come with greater chances of loss.

## Key ideas
- Risk and return are directly linked: high risk can bring high returns.
- Low risk investments typically offer lower returns.
- Investors should pick investments based on their comfort with risk and desired rewards.
- Long-term investing can help manage risks better, especially in stocks.
- Portfolios mix different assets to balance overall risk and return.

## Simple example
If you put $1,000 in a safe savings account with 2% return, you'll earn $20 in a year. But if you invest in stocks with a 10% expected return, you could earn $100 but also risk losing some money.
