# Emergency Fund Size: The 3–6 Months Rule

**Summary:** An emergency fund is money saved to cover unexpected costs like job loss or urgent bills. Experts commonly advise keeping 3 to 6 months of living expenses set aside for financial security. This fund should be quick to access and reserved only for real emergencies.

## Key ideas
- Emergency fund covers sudden expenses without using credit or loans.
- Size recommendation: 3 to 6 months of essential living costs.
- Helps avoid debt during financial shocks like job loss or medical bills.
- Should be kept in a safe, liquid account for easy access.
- Avoid using this fund for non-urgent spending.
- Clear high-interest debt first before prioritizing large emergency savings.

## Simple example
If your monthly essential expenses are $2,000, aim to save between $6,000 (3 months) and $12,000 (6 months) for emergencies. This reserve covers your basic needs if your income stops temporarily.
