# What is a Stock Split and Why It Happens

**Summary:** A stock split increases the number of shares a company has by dividing existing shares. This lowers the price of each share, making stocks more affordable without changing the company's total value.

## Key ideas
- Stock splits increase shares but do not change company value.
- They lower the share price to make stocks more accessible.
- Common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1.
- Splits improve stock liquidity and trading volume.
- Reverse splits reduce shares to raise the share price.
- Stock splits often signal confidence in company growth.

## Simple example
If you own 1 share priced at $100, a 2-for-1 stock split means you get 2 shares worth $50 each. You now have more shares at a lower price, but your total investment value remains $100.
