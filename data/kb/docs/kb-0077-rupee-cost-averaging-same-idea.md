# Rupee-Cost Averaging Explained

**Summary:** Rupee-cost averaging is an investment method where you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market prices. This approach helps reduce the impact of market volatility by spreading out purchases over time.

## Key ideas
- Invest a fixed sum at regular intervals, not all at once.
- Buys more units when prices are low, fewer when prices are high.
- Reduces the risk of investing a large sum at a market peak.
- Encourages disciplined investing and long-term growth.
- Works well for volatile markets or uncertain conditions.

## Simple example
If you invest Rs.1,000 every month, you may buy 10 units at Rs.100 each one month, and about 13 units at Rs.75 each the next. Over time, the average cost per unit becomes lower than buying all at once.
