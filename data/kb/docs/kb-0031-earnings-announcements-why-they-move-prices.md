# Why Earnings Announcements Move Stock Prices

**Summary:** Earnings announcements reveal a company's profit for a period, influencing investor decisions. Prices rise or fall based on whether results beat or miss expectations. Market anticipation and analyst estimates also impact price changes around these announcements.

## Key ideas
- Earnings announcements report company profits, usually quarterly.
- Stock prices react to how results compare with analyst estimates.
- Better-than-expected earnings usually push prices up, worse results cause drops.
- Investors speculate before announcements, causing price volatility.
- Analysts use models and company reports to forecast expected earnings.
- External factors like industry trends and economy also influence price reactions.

## Simple example
If a company expected to earn $1.00 per share announces $1.20, its stock price often rises as investors see stronger profits. Conversely, if earnings come in at $0.80, the price usually drops because profits were weaker than forecasted.
