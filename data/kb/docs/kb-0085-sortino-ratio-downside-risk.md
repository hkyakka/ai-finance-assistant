# Sortino Ratio: Measuring Downside Risk

**Summary:** The Sortino ratio evaluates investment returns by focusing only on the harmful volatility or downside risk, ignoring positive fluctuations. It improves on the Sharpe ratio by considering only negative returns in the risk calculation, giving a clearer picture of risk-adjusted performance.

## Key ideas
- Sortino ratio uses downside deviation instead of total standard deviation.
- It compares excess return (over risk-free rate) to downside risk.
- Positive volatility is not punished, only negative volatility is considered.
- A higher Sortino ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns.
- Useful for investors who want to understand risk from losses only.

## Simple example
If Mutual Fund X has a 12% return, 10% downside risk, and risk-free rate is 2.5%, its Sortino ratio = (12% - 2.5%) ÷ 10% = 0.95. Mutual Fund Z with 10% return and 7% downside risk has a Sortino ratio = (10% - 2.5%) ÷ 7% = 1.07, indicating Fund Z offers better returns per unit of bad risk.
