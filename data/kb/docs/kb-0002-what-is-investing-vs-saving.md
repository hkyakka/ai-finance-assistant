# Investing vs Saving: Key Differences

**Summary:** Saving means putting money aside safely for short-term needs with low risk. Investing involves using money to buy assets that may grow in value over time but carry higher risk. Investing aims for higher returns, while saving focuses on security.

## Key ideas
- Saving is low risk but usually earns less interest.
- Investing can grow your money more but involves taking risks.
- Savings are good for short-term goals or emergencies.
- Investing suits long-term goals like retirement or education.
- Inflation can reduce the value of money kept only in savings.
- Investments can help beat inflation and build wealth over time.

## Simple example
If you save Rs. 20,000 per month in a bank account with low interest, you might have Rs. 4.8 lakhs after 2 years. But if you invest the same amount with a 12% annual return, you could earn over Rs. 5.3 lakhs because your money grows over time.
