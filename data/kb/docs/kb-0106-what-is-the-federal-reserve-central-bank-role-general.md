# Role of the Federal Reserve (Central Bank)

**Summary:** The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States that helps keep the economy stable and safe. It manages the country's money supply, regulates banks, and provides financial services to other banks and the government.

## Key ideas
- Controls monetary policy to influence the economy.
- Regulates and supervises banks to ensure safety and soundness.
- Acts as a lender of last resort for banks in need.
- Maintains financial stability and minimizes systemic risks.
- Operates payment systems to transfer funds quickly and securely.

## Simple example
If the economy is slowing down, the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates to encourage people to borrow and spend. For example, they might reduce rates from 3% to 2%, making loans cheaper and boosting economic activity.
