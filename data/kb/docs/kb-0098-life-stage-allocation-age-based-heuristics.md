# Life-Stage Allocation (Age-Based Heuristics)

**Summary:** Life-stage allocation adjusts your investment mix based on your age to balance risk and reward. Younger investors typically hold more stocks for growth, while older investors shift toward safer assets like bonds and cash.

## Key ideas
- Younger people usually invest more in stocks for long-term growth.
- As you age, your portfolio becomes more conservative by adding bonds and cash.
- A common rule is to subtract your age from 100 (or 110/120) to find the stock percentage.
- This approach helps manage risk as retirement nears.
- Life-cycle or target-date funds automate this age-based allocation.
- Adjusting allocation over time aligns investments with changing goals and risk tolerance.

## Simple example
If you are 30 years old, using the rule '100 minus age,' you would invest 70% in stocks and 30% in bonds or cash. By age 60, this shifts to 40% stocks and 60% bonds/cash to reduce risk.
