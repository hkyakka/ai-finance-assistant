# Index Funds vs Active Funds

**Summary:** Index funds aim to match the returns of a market benchmark by passively holding its stocks, while active funds try to beat the benchmark through stock selection. Active funds rely on managers' strategies and typically have higher costs than index funds.

## Key ideas
- Index funds track a benchmark like Nifty 50 and aim to mirror its returns minus costs.
- Active funds seek to outperform the benchmark by picking stocks using strategies like value or growth investing.
- Index funds usually have lower fees due to passive management.
- Active funds involve more buying and selling, leading to higher expenses.
- Benchmarks help compare fund performance by showing what passive investing returns.
- Index funds offer broad market exposure with less effort and cost.

## Simple example
If the Nifty 50 index returns 10% in a year, an index fund tracking it might return around 9.8% after a 0.2% fee. An active fund manager aims for more than 10%, like 12%, but there is no guarantee and fees may reduce returns.
