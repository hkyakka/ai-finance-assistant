# Benchmarking Portfolio Performance

**Summary:** Benchmarking is comparing a portfolio's returns to a relevant market standard or index. It helps investors understand if their investments are performing well relative to similar investments or the overall market.

## Key ideas
- A benchmark is a market index representing a group of securities (e.g., S&P 500 for large US stocks).
- Portfolios and funds use benchmarks to measure returns and risk against market standards.
- Mutual funds often aim to outperform their benchmark index.
- Benchmarks vary by asset class and investor goals, such as bonds or small-cap stocks.
- Comparing returns without benchmarks makes it hard to judge performance.
- ETFs often track benchmarks passively, while active funds try to beat them.

## Simple example
If your equity portfolio returns 9% in a year but the S&P 500 index (its benchmark) returns 12%, your portfolio underperformed by 3%. Benchmarking shows you how your investments compare to the market or peers.
