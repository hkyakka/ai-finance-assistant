# What is a Stock / Equity Share?

**Summary:** A stock, also called an equity share, represents ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a part of that company and can benefit if it grows or pays dividends.

## Key ideas
- Stocks show your ownership stake in a company.
- Owning stock means you share in company profits and losses.
- The value of stocks depends on the company's financial health and market conditions.
- Stockholders' equity is the company's assets minus its liabilities, reflecting owners' net worth.
- Positive stockholders' equity means the company has more assets than debts; negative may signal financial trouble.

## Simple example
If a company has total assets worth $1,000,000 and total liabilities of $600,000, its stockholders' equity is $400,000. If you own 10,000 shares and the total shares are 100,000, you own 10% of the company and share in its net worth accordingly.
