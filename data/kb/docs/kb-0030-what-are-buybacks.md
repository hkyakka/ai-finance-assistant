# Understanding Buybacks

**Summary:** Buybacks occur when a company buys back its own shares from the market. This reduces the total shares available, often increasing the value of remaining shares and signaling confidence in the company’s future.

## Key ideas
- Buybacks reduce the number of shares in circulation.
- They can raise earnings per share (EPS) by spreading profits over fewer shares.
- Companies use buybacks to show optimism or prevent unwanted takeovers.
- Buybacks may indicate shares are undervalued and offer a reward to shareholders.
- Critics worry buybacks can drain cash and signal fewer growth options.

## Simple example
If a company has 1,000 shares and buys back 200, only 800 shares remain. If total earnings are $1,000, earnings per share rise from $1.00 ($1,000/1,000) to $1.25 ($1,000/800), potentially increasing each share’s value.
