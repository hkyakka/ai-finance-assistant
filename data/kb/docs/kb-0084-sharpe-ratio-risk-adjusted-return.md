# Sharpe Ratio: Measuring Risk-Adjusted Return

**Summary:** The Sharpe ratio helps measure how well an investment performs compared to its risk. It shows if the returns are due to smart choices or just taking on more risk.

## Key ideas
- Developed by William F. Sharpe in 1966 to assess return relative to risk.
- Calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the investment return, then dividing by the return's standard deviation.
- Higher Sharpe ratio means better risk-adjusted return.
- Uses standard deviation as a measure of total risk (volatility).
- Useful for comparing different investments or funds on a risk-adjusted basis.

## Simple example
If a fund returns 12% with a risk-free rate of 3% and a standard deviation of 10%, its Sharpe ratio is (12% - 3%) ÷ 10% = 0.9. This means the fund earned 0.9 units of return for each unit of risk taken.
