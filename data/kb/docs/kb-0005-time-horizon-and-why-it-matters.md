# Time Horizon and Its Importance in Investing

**Summary:** Time horizon is the length of time you plan to hold an investment to meet financial goals. It helps determine how much risk you can take and what types of investments are suitable. Longer horizons usually allow more risk for higher potential returns, while shorter horizons favor safer choices.

## Key ideas
- Time horizon is the planned period to keep an investment.
- Short-term horizons are less than 5 years, favoring safer options like savings accounts.
- Medium-term horizons span 3 to 10 years, recommending a mix of stocks and bonds.
- Long-term horizons exceed 10 years, allowing riskier investments like stocks.
- Longer horizons benefit from compounding and reduce the chance of losses.
- Aligning investments with your time horizon helps balance risk and growth.

## Simple example
If you want to buy a house in 4 years, you might choose safer bonds to avoid losing money. But for retirement in 30 years, investing in stocks can grow your money more despite short-term ups and downs.
