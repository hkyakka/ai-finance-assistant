# Reinvestment Risk in Coupon Payments

**Summary:** Reinvestment risk happens when an investor can't reinvest coupon payments at the same interest rate as the original bond. This risk affects the total returns, especially if interest rates drop after receiving coupons. Zero-coupon bonds avoid this risk since they pay no periodic interest.

## Key ideas
- Reinvestment risk means earning less if coupons are reinvested at lower rates.
- Zero-coupon bonds have no reinvestment risk because they pay only at maturity.
- Callable bonds have higher reinvestment risk as they may be redeemed early when rates fall.
- Bond ladders and non-callable bonds can help reduce reinvestment risk.
- Reinvestment risk impacts income-focused investors, like retirees, relying on steady cash flows.

## Simple example
An investor buys a 10-year bond paying 6% annual coupons. After one year, interest rates drop to 4%. If the investor reinvests the first coupon payment of $6,000 at 4% instead of 6%, the coupon income from reinvestment will be lower, reducing overall earnings.
