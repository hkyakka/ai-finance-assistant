# Basics of ROE and ROCE

**Summary:** ROE and ROCE are key financial ratios used to measure a company's profitability. ROE shows profit generated from shareholders' equity, while ROCE evaluates how well all capital, including debt, is used to produce profit.

## Key ideas
- ROE = Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity, shows return on investors' money.
- ROCE = EBIT ÷ Capital Employed, assesses profit from both equity and debt.
- ROE focuses only on equity; ROCE includes total capital (equity + debt).
- Higher ROE implies efficient use of shareholder funds; higher ROCE means better overall capital use.
- ROCE is useful for comparing companies in capital-heavy industries.
- Use both ratios together for a fuller view of company performance.

## Simple example
If a company earns $100,000 net income and has $500,000 equity, ROE is 20% ($100,000 ÷ $500,000). If the same company has EBIT of $150,000 and capital employed of $750,000, its ROCE is 20% ($150,000 ÷ $750,000). Both show how well the company uses money to make profit.
