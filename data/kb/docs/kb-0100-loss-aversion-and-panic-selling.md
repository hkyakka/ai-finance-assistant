# Loss Aversion and Panic Selling

**Summary:** Loss aversion makes investors fear losing money more than they enjoy gaining it. This fear can trigger panic selling when prices drop, often leading to poor financial decisions. Preparing mentally for losses helps reduce emotional reactions and promotes better trading choices.

## Key ideas
- Investors feel stronger pain from losses than pleasure from gains.
- Fear of loss can cause premature selling, known as panic selling.
- Overconfidence may cause underestimating the emotional impact of losses.
- Accepting losses as normal prevents panic and impulsive trades.
- Mental preparation and realistic risk management reduce harmful emotional responses.

## Simple example
Imagine you invest $1,000 in a stock that falls to $800. Loss aversion might make you panic and sell quickly to avoid more loss. But if you accept some loss as normal and stay calm, you might hold the stock until it recovers, avoiding a premature sale.
