# Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Basics

**Summary:** Dollar-cost averaging is an investing method where you put the same amount of money into an investment regularly, regardless of its price. This approach helps reduce the risk of investing a large sum at a wrong time and smooths out the effects of market ups and downs.

## Key ideas
- Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, ignoring market price changes.
- Buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high.
- Lowers the average cost per share over time.
- Reduces the stress of trying to time the market.
- Works well for new investors and those investing small amounts regularly.
- Does not protect fully against a prolonged market decline.

## Simple example
If you invest $1,000 monthly in a fund, and the share price drops from $20 to $12, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. Over several months, this balances out your average purchase price.
