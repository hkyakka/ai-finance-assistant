# Understanding Currency Risk in International Investing

**Summary:** Currency risk happens when exchange rates change, affecting the value of foreign investments. This risk can cause gains or losses beyond the performance of the investment itself.

## Key ideas
- Currency risk arises from fluctuations between the home currency and foreign currency values.
- It can boost or reduce investment returns when converting profits back to the home currency.
- Political events, inflation, and economic factors influence currency movements.
- Investors can hedge risk using tools like futures, options, or currency-related ETFs.
- Diversifying across countries can help reduce overall currency risk exposure.

## Simple example
If you invest $1,000 in Canadian stocks and earn 15%, but the Canadian dollar falls 15% against the U.S. dollar, your net gain in U.S. dollars could be near zero after currency conversion.
