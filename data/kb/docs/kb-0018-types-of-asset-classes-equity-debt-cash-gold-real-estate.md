# Types of Asset Classes

**Summary:** Asset classes are groups of investments with similar traits and market behaviors. Common classes include equity, debt, cash, gold, and real estate, each serving different roles in a portfolio.

## Key ideas
- Equity represents ownership in companies through stocks, offering potential growth but with higher risk.
- Debt assets like bonds provide regular interest payments and are generally less risky than equities.
- Cash and cash equivalents include savings and money market instruments, offering low risk and liquidity but lower returns.
- Gold and precious metals are tangible assets valued for rarity and used as a hedge during market stress.
- Real estate involves owning land or buildings and can generate rental income or appreciate over time.
- Diversifying across different asset classes helps reduce risk and balance returns.

## Simple example
An investor has $10,000 split into $4,000 in stocks (equity), $3,000 in bonds (debt), $2,000 in cash savings, and $1,000 in gold. This mix helps balance potential growth and safety while protecting against inflation.
