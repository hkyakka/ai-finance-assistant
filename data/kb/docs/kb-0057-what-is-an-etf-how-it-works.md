# What is an ETF and How It Works

**Summary:** An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a basket of different securities like stocks or bonds that trades on stock exchanges like a regular stock. ETFs allow investors to buy or sell shares anytime during market hours, unlike mutual funds which trade only once a day.

## Key ideas
- ETFs pool money from many investors to buy a group of assets.
- They trade on exchanges with prices that change throughout the day.
- ETFs combine benefits of mutual funds and stocks offering diversification and liquidity.
- They usually have lower fees compared to mutual funds.
- ETFs can track indexes, commodities, or strategies.
- Investors need a demat account to trade ETFs in India.

## Simple example
If an ETF tracks the Nifty 50 index, and the ETF share costs Rs 100, buying 10 shares means investing Rs 1,000 in a slice of 50 big companies. You can sell these shares anytime during the market hours at market price.
