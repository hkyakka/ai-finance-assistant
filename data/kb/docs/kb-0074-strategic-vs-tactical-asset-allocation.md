# Strategic vs Tactical Asset Allocation

**Summary:** Strategic asset allocation sets long-term target percentages for asset classes based on risk and goals, then rebalances periodically. Tactical asset allocation actively adjusts these targets short-term to exploit market opportunities, while still aiming to return to the original mix.

## Key ideas
- Strategic allocation focuses on a stable, long-term allocation mix.
- Tactical allocation makes short-term adjustments to benefit from market trends.
- Strategic uses a buy-and-hold approach; tactical is moderately active.
- Tactical shifts are usually small (5-10%) and temporary.
- Rebalancing restores strategic targets; tactical changes alter them temporarily.

## Simple example
Mrs. Smith has $500,000 allocated 40% equities, 40% bonds, and 20% cash. After a year, equities grow to $220,000 and she sells $7,200 to rebalance back to $212,800. If she used tactical allocation, she might temporarily increase equities above 40% to take advantage of expected gains.
