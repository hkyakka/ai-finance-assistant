# Diversification Basics

**Summary:** Diversification is a strategy that spreads investments across different assets to reduce risk. By mixing various investments, it helps protect your portfolio from sharp losses in any one area.

## Key ideas
- Diversification lowers risk by combining different types of investments.
- It works best with assets that do not move exactly the same way.
- Spreading investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets helps balance ups and downs.
- Holding about 25 to 30 different stocks is often enough to reduce risk effectively.
- Diversification does not fully eliminate the chance of loss but helps manage it.

## Simple example
Imagine you invest $5,000 split evenly between tech stocks, government bonds, and real estate funds. If tech shares drop 20%, your bonds and real estate investments may not fall, lowering your total loss compared to owning only tech stocks.
