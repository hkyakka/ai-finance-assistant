# Market vs Limit Orders

**Summary:** Market orders buy or sell stocks immediately at the best available price. Limit orders set a specific price and only execute if the market reaches that price.

## Key ideas
- Market orders provide fast execution but price may vary slightly.
- Limit orders give price control but might not be filled.
- Market orders suit stable, high-volume stocks.
- Limit orders help protect against price swings in volatile markets.
- Choosing order type depends on your trading goal and risk tolerance.

## Simple example
If a stock is trading at $50, a market order buys it immediately near $50. A limit order set at $48 will only buy if the price drops to $48 or less.
