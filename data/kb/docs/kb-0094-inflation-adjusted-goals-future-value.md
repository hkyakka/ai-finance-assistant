# Inflation-Adjusted Goals and Future Value

**Summary:** Inflation reduces the buying power of money over time, so setting financial targets requires adjusting for inflation. This helps ensure your future savings can meet your actual needs. Using future value calculations, you can estimate how much money you will need to maintain your lifestyle in the future.

## Key ideas
- Inflation makes money worth less in the future, so costs will be higher than today.
- Inflation-adjusted goals show the real amount needed to maintain purchasing power.
- Future Value (FV) formula helps calculate how much current money will grow accounting for inflation.
- Planning retirement or long-term goals requires estimating costs in future rupees, not today’s rupees.
- Ignoring inflation risks underestimating the amount needed to reach financial goals.

## Simple example
If you need Rs. 50,000 per month today, in 25 years this amount will be higher due to inflation. Assuming 6% inflation, after 25 years you will need about Rs. 214,000 per month (50,000 × (1.06^25)) to have the same buying power.
