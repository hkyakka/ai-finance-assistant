# Simple Diversification Score

**Summary:** The Simple Diversification Score is a quick way to measure how spread out investments are. It helps ensure your portfolio isn't too focused on one asset or type. This score serves as a basic guide to avoid high risk from lack of variety.

## Key ideas
- Diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across different assets.
- A higher score means better spread and lower concentration risk.
- It is a heuristic, not a precise formula, useful for quick checks.
- Helps beginners understand if their investments are well balanced.
- Useful in assessing how evenly investment amounts are divided.

## Simple example
Imagine you invest $1000 divided into 4 stocks with $250 each. The diversification score would be higher than if $1000 was invested only in one stock, showing better risk spreading.
