# Alpha: Investment Performance Beyond Benchmark

**Summary:** Alpha measures how much an investment outperforms or underperforms a benchmark after adjusting for risk. A positive alpha means the investment did better than the benchmark, showing the manager's added value. Negative alpha indicates it performed worse than the benchmark.

## Key ideas
- Alpha shows excess return compared to a market index or benchmark.
- Positive alpha indicates outperformance; negative means underperformance.
- It reflects the skill of a portfolio manager beyond market movements.
- Alpha is often assessed alongside beta, which measures market risk.
- Achieving consistent alpha is difficult due to market efficiency.
- Management fees can reduce the net benefit of positive alpha.

## Simple example
If a portfolio returns 12% while its benchmark index returns 10%, the alpha is +2%, meaning the portfolio earned 2% more than the benchmark after adjusting for risk.
