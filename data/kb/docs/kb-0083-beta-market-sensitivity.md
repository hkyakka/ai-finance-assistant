# Understanding Beta: Market Sensitivity of Stocks

**Summary:** Beta shows how much a stock's price moves compared to the overall market. It helps investors understand the risk level of a stock relative to market changes. Stocks with beta above 1 are more volatile, while those below 1 are less volatile than the market.

## Key ideas
- Beta measures stock price volatility against the market (market beta = 1).
- Beta > 1 means the stock moves more than the market (riskier).
- Beta < 1 means the stock moves less than the market (safer).
- Used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate expected returns.
- Found on financial websites next to stock information.
- Helps balance portfolio risk by mixing high and low beta stocks.

## Simple example
If the market goes up 10%, a stock with beta of 1.5 might rise 15%, showing higher sensitivity. A stock with beta 0.5 might only increase 5%, indicating lower sensitivity to market moves.
