# Basic Rules of Position Sizing

**Summary:** Position sizing helps decide how much money to put into a trade based on total capital. It limits the risk on any single trade and supports better money management. Different techniques exist and traders should select ones that fit their style.

## Key ideas
- Position sizing answers how much capital to risk on a trade.
- A common rule is to risk no more than 5-10% of total equity per trade.
- Equity capital can be estimated using different models like core equity, total equity, or reduced equity.
- Three basic position sizing methods: unit per fixed amount, percentage margin, and percentage of volatility.
- Choosing one method for equity and one or two for position sizing helps avoid complexity.

## Simple example
If you have Rs.100,000 and follow a 5% position sizing rule, you risk up to Rs.5,000 on a trade. Using the unit per fixed amount method, you might buy 1 lot of a futures contract for every Rs.100,000 in your account.
