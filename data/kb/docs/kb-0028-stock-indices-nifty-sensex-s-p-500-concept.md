# Understanding Stock Indices: Nifty, Sensex, and S&P 500

**Summary:** Stock indices track the performance of selected top companies to show overall market trend. They help investors quickly understand if the market is going up, down, or sideways. Popular indices include India's Nifty 50 and Sensex, and the USA's S&P 500.

## Key ideas
- Stock indices represent a group of important companies, reflecting the market’s health.
- Sensex covers 30 large companies from Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
- Nifty 50 tracks 50 major stocks on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
- S&P 500 includes 500 large U.S. companies and shows broader market trends.
- Index movements indicate investor confidence about future economy.
- Indices simplify market analysis without checking every stock.

## Simple example
If the Nifty 50 index rises from 15,820 to 18,150 in six months, it means the market increased by about 14.75%. Investors feel optimistic about the economy, as many leading stocks performed well.
