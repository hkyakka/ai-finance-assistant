# Why Goal-Based Investing Beats Picking Individual Stocks

**Summary:** Goal-based investing focuses on achieving specific financial objectives rather than just selecting stocks. It helps investors create a clear plan and manage risk better compared to trying to find winning stocks on their own.

## Key ideas
- Start by defining what you want to achieve with your money (e.g., retirement, buying a home).
- Goal-based investing builds a diversified portfolio aligned with your needs and timeline.
- Picking individual stocks requires constant research and can be risky and time-consuming.
- Having a clear goal reduces emotional decisions caused by daily market changes.
- A goal-oriented approach balances growth and safety depending on your investment horizon.

## Simple example
If you want to save $50,000 in 10 years for a car, goal-based investing helps you pick a mix of investments expected to grow steadily to reach that amount. Instead of guessing which stock will do well, you focus on a plan with steady returns that match your timeline.
