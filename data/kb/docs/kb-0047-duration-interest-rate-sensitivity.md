# Duration: Interest Rate Sensitivity of Bonds

**Summary:** Duration shows how much a bond's price changes when interest rates change, reflecting its risk level. It measures the weighted average time to receive bond payments and helps investors manage interest rate risk.

## Key ideas
- Duration estimates price sensitivity of bonds to interest rate changes.
- Higher duration means greater price drop when rates rise.
- Factors affecting duration include bond maturity and coupon rate.
- Duration differs from maturity; it changes with interest rates.
- Types include Macaulay, modified, effective, and key rate duration.

## Simple example
A bond with a 5-year duration will lose about 5% of its value if interest rates rise by 1%. For example, a $1,000 bond would drop roughly to $950 if rates increase 1%. This shows how duration helps predict bond price risk.
