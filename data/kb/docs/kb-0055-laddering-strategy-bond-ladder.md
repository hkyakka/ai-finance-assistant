# Bond Laddering Strategy

**Summary:** Bond laddering involves buying bonds with different maturity dates to reduce risk and improve cash flow. This strategy helps investors avoid locking in low rates and provides regular opportunities to reinvest as bonds mature.

## Key ideas
- Buy bonds maturing at different times, spreading risk over several years.
- Regular bond maturity provides steady income and reinvestment chances.
- Protects against interest rate changes by avoiding long-term lock-ins.
- Diversifies credit risk by including bonds from different issuers.
- Shorter maturity bonds improve liquidity; longer ones may offer higher yields.

## Simple example
An investor buys five bonds costing $1,000 each, with maturities from 1 to 5 years. Each year, one bond matures, returning $1,000 to the investor, who can reinvest it at the current interest rate. This ensures steady income and flexibility to adjust investments with changing rates.
