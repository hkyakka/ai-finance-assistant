# Framework for When to Sell an Investment

**Summary:** Deciding when to sell an investment depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Using structured strategies helps avoid emotional decisions and improve investment outcomes.

## Key ideas
- Set clear financial goals and time horizons before investing.
- Sell when an investment hits a predetermined price or valuation target.
- Consider selling to free up capital for better investment opportunities.
- Sell if company fundamentals worsen significantly.
- Use a strategy to avoid emotional decisions based on short-term market moves.

## Simple example
If you buy a stock at $50 and set a target price of $70, you may sell once the price reaches $70. Alternatively, if the company's earnings drop sharply, you might decide to sell earlier even if the price is below your target.
