# What is Rebalancing and Why Do It

**Summary:** Rebalancing means adjusting your investment portfolio to keep the original mix of assets. It helps manage risk and keeps your investments aligned with your financial goals as market values change.

## Key ideas
- Rebalancing maintains your target asset allocation despite market changes.
- It reduces risk by preventing overexposure to certain assets.
- Common strategies include calendar-based and threshold-based rebalancing.
- It encourages disciplined investing, like selling high and buying low.
- Rebalancing may involve some transaction costs but helps keep goals on track.

## Simple example
If you want 60% stocks and 40% bonds, but stocks rise to 70% of your portfolio, rebalancing means selling some stocks and buying bonds to return to the original 60/40 mix.
