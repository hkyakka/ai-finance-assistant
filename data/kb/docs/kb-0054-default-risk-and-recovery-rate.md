# Default Risk and Recovery Rate Basics

**Summary:** Default risk refers to the chance that a borrower will fail to repay a loan. Recovery rate measures how much money lenders get back after a borrower defaults. Both help lenders decide loan terms and interest rates.

## Key ideas
- Default risk is the chance a borrower won't make required payments.
- Higher default risk often leads to higher interest rates.
- Recovery rate is the percentage of debt repaid after default.
- Senior debt usually has a higher recovery rate than junior debt.
- Recovery rate helps calculate loss given default (LGD).
- Economic and company factors affect both default risk and recovery rate.

## Simple example
If a business owes $200,000 and defaults after repaying $40,000, the recovery rate is 20% (40,000 ÷ 200,000). If the recovery rate is 20%, the loss given default is 80%, meaning lenders lose most of the loan.
