# ETF vs Mutual Fund: Key Differences

**Summary:** ETFs and mutual funds both allow investors to diversify by pooling money to buy various assets. ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day with generally lower fees, while mutual funds trade once daily and often have active management with higher costs.

## Key ideas
- ETFs trade on stock exchanges anytime market is open; mutual funds trade once after market close.
- ETFs usually have lower fees due to passive management; mutual funds often charge more for active management.
- ETFs offer tax advantages since capital gains taxes apply mostly when shares are sold.
- Mutual funds provide professional management and stronger regulatory oversight.
- Both help investors diversify with small amounts by holding many different securities.

## Simple example
If you buy $1,000 of an ETF at 10 AM, you can sell it at 3 PM at the current price. A mutual fund bought at 10 AM will only be priced and tradable after market closes, so you cannot sell during the day.
