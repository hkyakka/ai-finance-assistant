# Understanding CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)

**Summary:** CAGR shows the average yearly growth rate of an investment over a set time, assuming profits are reinvested. It smooths out fluctuations to give a clearer picture of performance over multiple years.

## Key ideas
- CAGR calculates a steady growth rate from start to end value across years.
- It assumes reinvestment of profits to reflect compounding.
- CAGR helps compare different investments or benchmark performance.
- It doesn’t measure investment risk or volatility.
- Calculation involves dividing ending value by starting value, raising to 1/years, then subtracting one.

## Simple example
If you invest $1,000 and it grows to $1,331 in 3 years, CAGR is calculated as ((1331/1000)^(1/3)) - 1 = 0.10 or 10% per year. This means your investment grew by 10% each year on average.
