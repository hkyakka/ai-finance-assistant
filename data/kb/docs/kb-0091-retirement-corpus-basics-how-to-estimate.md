# Estimating Your Retirement Corpus

**Summary:** A retirement corpus is the amount of money you need saved by retirement to maintain your lifestyle. Estimating it requires knowing your monthly expenses and expected retirement duration. Then, factor in investment growth and inflation to find the target corpus.

## Key ideas
- Retirement corpus is the total savings needed to cover post-retirement expenses.
- Calculate monthly disposable income needed after retirement as a base.
- Multiply yearly expense by expected years in retirement to get a rough estimate.
- Adjust for inflation and investment returns to get a realistic corpus target.
- Invest regularly in diversified assets, ideally with a growth-oriented approach.
- Assumptions and conservative estimates help avoid underfunding your retirement.

## Simple example
If you need ₹50,000/month after retirement and expect to live 20 years post-retirement, your total expense is ₹12,000,000 (₹600,000 per year × 20 years). Considering investment returns, you may need around ₹7 crore saved by retirement to maintain that income.
