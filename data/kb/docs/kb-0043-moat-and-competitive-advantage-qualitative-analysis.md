# Moat and Competitive Advantage in Qualitative Analysis

**Summary:** A moat refers to a company's lasting competitive edge that protects it from rivals and helps maintain profitability. Identifying a strong economic moat is key for investors who want companies that can sustain success over time.

## Key ideas
- Economic moats act like barriers protecting a company's profits and market share.
- Common moat types include strong brands, cost advantages, patents, and high switching costs.
- Moats help companies fend off competition and maintain long-term performance.
- Investors use moats to select durable, investable companies.
- Qualitative analysis includes evaluating a company’s competitive position and market strength.

## Simple example
Imagine a company whose brand loyalty lets it charge 20% more than competitors. This pricing power helps keep customers returning, boosting profit margins from 10% to 15%, showing a clear moat through brand advantage.
