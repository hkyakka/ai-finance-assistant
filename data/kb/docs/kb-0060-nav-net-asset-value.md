# Understanding Net Asset Value (NAV)

**Summary:** NAV represents the value of a fund's assets minus its liabilities. It shows how much each share of a fund is worth at the end of the business day and helps investors know the price to buy or sell fund shares.

## Key ideas
- NAV = total assets minus total liabilities of the fund.
- Per-share NAV = NAV divided by number of shares outstanding.
- Calculated daily using closing prices of the fund's investments.
- Used to set the buying and selling price of mutual fund shares.
- A rising NAV doesn't always mean good performance; distributions and market changes also affect it.

## Simple example
If a fund has assets worth $111 million and liabilities worth $15 million, its NAV is $96 million. If there are 5 million shares outstanding, the NAV per share is $96 million divided by 5 million, which equals $19.20 per share.
