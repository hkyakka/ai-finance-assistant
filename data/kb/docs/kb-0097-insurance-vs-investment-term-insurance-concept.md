# Insurance vs Investment: Understanding Term Insurance

**Summary:** Term insurance provides financial protection for a fixed period without any savings component. It pays a death benefit only if the insured dies during the term, unlike investment-linked insurance plans that combine coverage with savings.

## Key ideas
- Term insurance offers pure protection without savings or investment returns.
- Premiums depend on age, health, and coverage amount.
- If the insured survives the term, there is no payout or return of premium.
- Savings-linked insurance mixes protection with investment but often has lower coverage.
- Term insurance is usually more affordable than savings-linked or whole life plans.
- It can sometimes be converted into permanent insurance before expiry.

## Simple example
Suppose you buy a 20-year term insurance policy with a coverage of ₹50 lakh. You pay ₹10,000 per year. If you pass away within the 20 years, your family receives ₹50 lakh. If you survive, you do not get any money back, but you had financial protection during this period.
