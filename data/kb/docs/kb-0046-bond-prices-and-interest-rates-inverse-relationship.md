# Inverse Relationship Between Bond Prices and Interest Rates

**Summary:** Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and when rates drop, bond prices increase.

## Key ideas
- Most bonds pay a fixed interest rate, called the coupon.
- If interest rates rise, existing bonds with lower rates become less attractive.
- To compete, prices of existing bonds fall, raising their yield to match new bonds.
- When interest rates drop, existing bonds become more valuable, pushing prices up.
- Zero-coupon bonds clearly show this because they pay no coupons but mature at par value.

## Simple example
Imagine a zero-coupon bond priced at $950 with a $1,000 value at maturity in one year, giving a 5.26% return. If new interest rates rise to 10%, this bond looks less attractive, so its market price would drop below $950 to offer a yield close to 10%. This price drop helps balance demand with current rates.
