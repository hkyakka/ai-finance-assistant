# Asset Allocation: Basics and Importance

**Summary:** Asset allocation is dividing investments among asset types like stocks, bonds, and cash. It helps balance risk and reward based on goals, risk tolerance, and investment time frame.

## Key ideas
- Assets include stocks, bonds, real estate, and precious metals.
- Different assets have different risks and return potentials.
- Proper allocation preserves wealth against inflation.
- Allocation varies by financial goals and investment horizon.
- More stocks for long-term goals; more cash for short-term needs.
- Risk tolerance also influences asset allocation decisions.

## Simple example
If you have $10,000 to invest for retirement in 30 years, you might put $7,000 in stocks, $2,000 in bonds, and keep $1,000 in cash. This mix aims for higher growth with stocks while bonds and cash reduce volatility and provide safety.
