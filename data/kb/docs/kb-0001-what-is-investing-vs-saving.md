# Investing vs Saving: Key Differences

**Summary:** Saving means setting money aside safely for short-term use, often with low risk and low returns. Investing involves using money to buy assets with the goal of growing it over time but carries higher risk and potential rewards.

## Key ideas
- Saving is low risk, usually in bank accounts with small interest.
- Investing can grow money faster but comes with more risk.
- Savings are good for emergencies and short-term goals.
- Investments suit long-term goals like retirement or education.
- Inflation can reduce the value of saved money over time.
- Investing helps combat inflation and build wealth.

## Simple example
If you save Rs.20,000 every month in a bank at 4% interest, after 20 years, you’ll have about Rs.6.5 lakh. But if you invest the same amount at 12% returns, it could grow to over Rs.4 crore, showing how investing can multiply wealth more effectively.
