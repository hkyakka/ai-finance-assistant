# Scenario Analysis Using Different Discount Rates (8%, 10%, 12%)

**Summary:** Scenario analysis helps forecast outcomes by applying different discount rates, showing how project value or investment returns change. By comparing results at 8%, 10%, and 12%, you can understand the sensitivity of the investment to changes in the required rate of return.

## Key ideas
- Scenario analysis tests how outcomes vary with different discount rates.
- Lower discount rates (e.g., 8%) increase present value, showing more optimistic results.
- Higher rates (e.g., 12%) reduce present value, reflecting higher risk or cost.
- This method helps in decision-making by visualizing possible profits or losses.
- It highlights the impact of interest rate changes on investment value.
- Useful for comparing project viability under various assumptions.

## Simple example
If an investment promises $1,000 in one year, discounting at 8% gives a present value of $925.93. At 10%, it drops to $909.09, and at 12%, it reduces further to $892.86. This shows how higher discount rates lower the value today.
