# Revenue vs Profit vs Cash Flow: Key Differences

**Summary:** Revenue is the total money earned from sales, profit is what remains after expenses, and cash flow shows actual cash entering and leaving the business. Understanding these helps assess a company's sales success, profitability, and liquidity.

## Key ideas
- Revenue is total income from selling goods or services.
- Profit is revenue minus all costs and expenses.
- Cash flow tracks real cash movement in and out of the business.
- Revenue shows sales performance; profit shows financial success.
- Cash flow indicates liquidity and ability to pay bills.
- A company can have high revenue but low cash if sales are on credit.

## Simple example
Imagine a shop selling 20 laptops at Rs. 25,000 each, total revenue is Rs. 500,000. If 5 laptops are sold on credit, only Rs. 375,000 is received as cash. Profit depends on deducting all costs from revenue, while cash flow shows the Rs. 375,000 actually available.
