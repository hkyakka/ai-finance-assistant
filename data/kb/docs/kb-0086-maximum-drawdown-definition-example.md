# Maximum Drawdown Explained

**Summary:** Maximum drawdown (MDD) is the largest drop in an investment’s value from its highest point to the lowest before a new high. It shows the biggest loss an investor could have faced during a specific time period.

## Key ideas
- MDD measures the worst loss from a peak to a trough of an investment.
- It is expressed as a percentage of the peak value lost.
- A lower MDD means the investment lost less value during downturns.
- MDD does not show how often losses happen or recovery time.
- It helps compare risk levels between different investments or strategies.

## Simple example
If a stock rises to $100 and then falls to $70 before going up again, the maximum drawdown is 30%, calculated as (70 - 100) ÷ 100 = -0.30 or -30%. This means the investment lost 30% from its highest point.
