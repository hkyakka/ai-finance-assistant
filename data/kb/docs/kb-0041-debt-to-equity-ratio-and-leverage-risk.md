# Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Leverage Risk

**Summary:** The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures how much a company uses debt compared to its own funds to finance operations. It helps assess financial risk and the company's reliance on borrowed money. Higher ratios indicate greater leverage and risk, while lower ratios suggest less use of debt.

## Key ideas
- D/E ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Shareholders' Equity.
- It shows how much debt a company uses relative to its own money.
- Higher D/E ratios mean higher financial risk due to more debt.
- Lower ratios might mean the company is not using debt to grow.
- Leverage means using borrowed money to increase potential returns.
- More leverage can boost profits but also increases risk if things go wrong.

## Simple example
If a company has $200,000 in debts and $100,000 in equity, its D/E ratio is 2. This means the company has twice as much debt as equity, indicating higher financial risk from borrowing.
