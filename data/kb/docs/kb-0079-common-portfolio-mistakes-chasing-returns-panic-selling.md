# Common Portfolio Mistakes: Chasing Returns and Panic Selling

**Summary:** Many investors make the mistake of following recent high returns, which can lead to buying at high prices. Panic selling during market drops often causes unnecessary losses. Avoiding emotional decisions helps maintain long-term growth.

## Key ideas
- Chasing returns means buying assets after they have already performed well, often too late.
- Panic selling is when investors sell quickly during market drops, locking in losses.
- Emotions like fear and greed can harm investment decisions.
- A long-term, patient approach usually gives better results.
- Regularly rebalancing your portfolio helps reduce risk and avoid emotional moves.

## Simple example
If a stock jumps 50% in one year, buying it right after may not be wise because the price could fall. For example, buying at $150 after a rise from $100 and then selling at $120 due to fear results in a loss, showing panic selling's impact.
