# Correlation and Diversification Benefit

**Summary:** Correlation measures how two assets move in relation to each other, ranging from -1 (opposite directions) to +1 (same direction). Diversification works best when assets are low or negatively correlated, helping reduce overall portfolio risk.

## Key ideas
- Correlation values range between -1 (perfect negative) and +1 (perfect positive).
- Low or negative correlation between assets helps reduce portfolio risk.
- Diversification means holding different types of assets to spread risk.
- Assets affected differently by economic factors tend to have lower correlation.
- Perfect zero correlation means asset movements are unrelated.

## Simple example
Suppose you invest $100 in Stock A and $100 in Bond B. If the correlation between them is -0.5, when Stock A loses value, Bond B is likely to gain, balancing your risks better than if both moved together.
