# Dividends and Dividend Yield Explained

**Summary:** Dividends are payments to shareholders from a company's profits, providing regular income. Dividend yield shows the annual return from dividends as a percentage of the current stock price.

## Key ideas
- Dividends are usually cash payments made by companies to reward shareholders.
- Dividend rate is the total dollar amount paid per share annually.
- Dividend yield is the dividend rate divided by the current stock price, shown as a percentage.
- Dividend yield helps investors understand the income return relative to investment cost.
- A rising dividend yield can mean decreasing stock price, not just higher dividends.
- Companies with steady profits, like utilities or consumer staples, often pay better dividends.

## Simple example
If a company pays $2 in dividends per share annually and its stock price is $40, the dividend yield is 5% ($2 ÷ $40). If the stock price drops to $30 but dividends stay $2, the yield increases to about 6.7%.
