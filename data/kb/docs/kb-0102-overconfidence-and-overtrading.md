# Overconfidence and Overtrading in Investing

**Summary:** Overconfidence makes investors trade more often, believing they will keep winning, but this can lower their overall returns. Overtrading leads to higher costs and can hurt long-term account balances. A balanced confidence helps traders manage risks better.

## Key ideas
- Overconfident investors trade frequently, often with risky bets.
- Early wins can reinforce overconfidence even if later results worsen.
- More trades mean higher fees, reducing net profits.
- Optimism without risk control may harm but moderate optimism can improve decision-making.
- Inconsistent rewards encourage persistent but risky trading behavior.
- Recognizing overconfidence helps avoid unnecessary losses.

## Simple example
If an investor starts with $10,000 and makes 30 trades paying $10 commission each, they spend $300 on fees. Even if they earn $500 from trades, after fees their profit drops to $200. Fewer trades with the same profit would keep more earnings.
