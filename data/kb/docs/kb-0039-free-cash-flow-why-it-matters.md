# Why Free Cash Flow Matters

**Summary:** Free cash flow (FCF) shows how much cash a company generates after covering expenses and investments. It is important because it indicates the company’s ability to grow, pay debts, and reward investors. Tracking FCF helps spot financial health and potential risks early.

## Key ideas
- FCF = Cash from operations minus capital expenditures.
- Strong FCF means more money for debt, dividends, and growth.
- Growing FCF often signals improving business performance.
- Declining FCF might warn of financial troubles.
- FCF can be manipulated; always check financial details carefully.

## Simple example
If a company makes $500,000 from operations and spends $200,000 on equipment, its free cash flow is $300,000 ($500,000 - $200,000). This $300,000 can be used to pay debts, distribute dividends, or invest in new projects.
