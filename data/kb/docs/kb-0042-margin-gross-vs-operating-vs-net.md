# Margin Types: Gross vs Operating vs Net

**Summary:** Gross, operating, and net profit margins show different profit levels on an income statement. They help understand how well a company controls costs and earns profit at various stages.

## Key ideas
- Gross margin measures profit after direct costs like materials and labor.
- Operating margin accounts for indirect costs like rent, salaries, and marketing.
- Net margin shows profit left after all expenses, including taxes and interest.
- Higher margins usually mean better efficiency and profitability.
- Each margin reveals different insights about company operations and expenses.

## Simple example
If a company has $100 in sales and $60 in direct costs, gross profit is $40, or 40%. After subtracting $20 of operating expenses, operating profit is $20, or 20%. Finally, after $5 of taxes and interest, net profit is $15, or 15%.
