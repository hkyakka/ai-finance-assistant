# Liquidity and Its Importance

**Summary:** Liquidity is how easily an asset can be turned into cash without changing its market price. It matters because liquid assets allow quick transactions at fair prices, reducing costs and risks.

## Key ideas
- Liquidity means converting assets to cash quickly and efficiently.
- Highly liquid assets trade at prices close to their true value.
- Illiquid assets may take longer to sell and often at lower prices.
- Liquidity affects trading costs and price stability in markets.
- Cash is the most liquid asset, while items like real estate are less liquid.

## Simple example
If you need $1,000 fast, cash is ready to use immediately. If you own a rare book worth $1,000, selling it may take weeks or require lowering the price to sell quickly, showing it is less liquid.
