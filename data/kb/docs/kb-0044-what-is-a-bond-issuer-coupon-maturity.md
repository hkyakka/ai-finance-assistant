# Basics of Bonds: Issuer, Coupon, and Maturity

**Summary:** A bond is a loan made by an investor to an issuer for a set period. The issuer pays interest called a coupon until the bond matures, when the face value is returned. The coupon rate is fixed and set when the bond is issued.

## Key ideas
- Issuer is the entity borrowing money by selling the bond.
- Coupon is the annual interest paid to bondholders, usually in fixed amounts.
- Coupon rate is the percentage of the bond's face value paid yearly as interest.
- Maturity is the bond’s end date when the issuer repays the original amount.
- Coupon payments are often split into two equal payments per year.
- The coupon rate stays the same, but the bond’s market price can change.

## Simple example
If a company issues a $1,000 bond with a 6% coupon rate and 5 years to maturity, the investor receives $60 a year (often $30 every six months) until the bond matures. At maturity, the company repays the $1,000 face value.
