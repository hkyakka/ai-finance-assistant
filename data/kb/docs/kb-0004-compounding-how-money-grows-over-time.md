# Understanding Compounding: How Money Grows Over Time

**Summary:** Compounding means earning interest on both your initial money and the interest already earned. This process helps your money grow faster over time because you earn "interest on interest." The more often interest is added, the faster the growth.

## Key ideas
- Compounding adds interest to the original amount plus previous interest.
- It causes money to grow faster than simple interest, which only applies to the original amount.
- Interest can compound daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly.
- The Rule of 72 estimates the time for an investment to double by dividing 72 by the interest rate.
- Compounding works both for investments (good) and debts (can increase what you owe).

## Simple example
If you invest $1,000 at 5% interest compounded yearly, after one year you earn $50 in interest. The next year, you earn interest on $1,050, so your money grows faster. After 3 years, you would have about $1,157.63.
