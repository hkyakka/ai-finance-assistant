# Spotting Fund Overlap: Avoiding Duplicate Investments

**Summary:** Fund overlap happens when two or more investment funds share many of the same stocks or assets, causing duplication in your portfolio. Identifying overlap helps maintain diversification and avoid unnecessary risk.

## Key ideas
- Fund overlap means holding the same stocks across multiple funds.
- Too much overlap reduces diversification benefits and increases risk.
- Look at top holdings in each fund to spot common investments.
- Use overlap analysis tools or compare fund factsheets for similarities.
- Avoid investing in multiple funds with more than 30-50% overlap.

## Simple example
If Fund A owns 10% in Company X and Fund B owns 15% in the same company, combining these could mean 25% exposure to Company X. This concentrates risk instead of spreading it.
