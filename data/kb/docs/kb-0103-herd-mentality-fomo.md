# Herd Mentality and FOMO in Investing

**Summary:** Herd mentality and FOMO (fear of missing out) cause investors to copy others and rush into popular investments without enough research. This behavior often leads to poor decisions and losses because people focus on short-term trends instead of long-term value.

## Key ideas
- FOMO is driven by social media hype and fear of missing quick gains.
- Following the crowd can result in buying overpriced assets after their peak.
- Investors often ignore long-term plans due to impulsive decisions.
- Research and patience help avoid mistakes caused by herd behavior.
- Warren Buffett advises being cautious when others are greedy, and opportunistic when others are fearful.

## Simple example
In early 2021, GameStop shares rose from $5 to $120 because many investors jumped in due to hype. Those joining late faced a sharp drop to about $11 shortly after, losing over 90%.
