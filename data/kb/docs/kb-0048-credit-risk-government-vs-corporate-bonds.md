# Credit Risk: Government vs Corporate Bonds

**Summary:** Credit risk refers to the chance that a bond issuer cannot pay back interest or principal. Government bonds generally have lower credit risk than corporate bonds, which usually pay higher interest to compensate for this risk.

## Key ideas
- Government bonds are backed by the government and have low default risk.
- Corporate bonds depend on a company's ability to pay, leading to higher credit risk.
- Higher credit risk in corporate bonds results in higher yields or interest rates.
- Credit ratings from agencies help assess the risk of corporate bonds.
- A downgrade in a bond's credit rating usually lowers its market price and increases yields.
- Investors can lose money if bonds default or if prices fall before maturity.

## Simple example
A government bond might pay 2% interest because it is very safe. A corporate bond from a mid-sized company might pay 6% due to higher credit risk. If the company is downgraded, the bond price may drop, causing losses if sold early.
