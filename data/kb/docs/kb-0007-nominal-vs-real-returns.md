# Nominal vs Real Returns

**Summary:** Nominal returns show the stated earnings on investments without adjusting for inflation. Real returns account for inflation, showing the actual gain in purchasing power.

## Key ideas
- Nominal return is the interest rate or gain before adjusting for inflation.
- Real return reflects the inflation-adjusted profit, indicating true growth.
- Real return = Nominal return - Inflation rate.
- Inflation reduces the purchasing power of nominal returns.
- Real returns give a clearer view of investment performance over time.

## Simple example
If an investment earns 5% nominally but inflation is 3%, the real return is only 2%. For example, $10,000 grows to $10,500 nominally, but inflation raises prices by 3%, so the real gain is $200 in purchasing power.
