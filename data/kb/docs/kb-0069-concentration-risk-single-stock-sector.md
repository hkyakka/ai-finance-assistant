# Concentration Risk in Single Stocks and Sectors

**Summary:** Concentration risk happens when investing too much money in one stock or sector. This increases the chance of bigger losses if that stock or sector performs poorly. Diversifying investments helps reduce this risk.

## Key ideas
- Putting a large part of your portfolio in a single stock or sector raises risk.
- Lack of diversification means poor performance in one area can greatly hurt overall returns.
- Concentration risk links to the risk-return tradeoff, where higher risk can mean higher reward but also bigger losses.
- Investors should balance risk by spreading investments across many stocks and sectors.
- Single-stock ETFs can increase concentration risk as they focus on one company.
- Monitoring portfolio concentration helps maintain an appropriate risk level.

## Simple example
If you invest $10,000 and put $7,000 in one technology stock and $3,000 in other stocks, 70% of your money is concentrated. If that tech stock drops 20%, your total portfolio loses $1,400, showing high risk from lack of diversification.
