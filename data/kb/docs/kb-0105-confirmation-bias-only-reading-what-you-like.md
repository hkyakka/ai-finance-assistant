# Confirmation Bias in Finance

**Summary:** Confirmation bias means favoring information that matches your existing beliefs while ignoring opposing facts. It can lead investors to make poor decisions by overlooking important data. Recognizing this bias helps improve decision-making and avoid costly mistakes.

## Key ideas
- People seek out info that supports their current views.
- Contradictory facts are ignored or undervalued.
- Bias affects research, interpretation, and memory.
- Leads to overconfidence and one-sided decisions.
- In investing, it can cause missed opportunities or bad timing.
- To reduce bias, consider opposing views and ask neutral questions.

## Simple example
If an investor believes a stock will rise, they might only read positive news about it. For instance, seeing a 10% profit report and ignoring a 5% drop in sales leads to a biased, overly optimistic view.
