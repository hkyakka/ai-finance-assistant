# Difference Between Yield and Coupon Rate

**Summary:** The coupon rate is the fixed interest percentage a bond pays annually based on its face value. Yield shows the actual return an investor gets, which changes with the bond's market price. Yield to maturity estimates the total return if the bond is held until it matures.

## Key ideas
- Coupon rate = fixed annual interest based on bond's face value.
- Yield varies with the bond’s current market price.
- When bond price = face value, coupon rate = yield.
- If bond price > face value, yield < coupon rate (premium).
- Yield to maturity estimates total return if held to maturity.
- Coupon payments stay the same regardless of bond price changes.

## Simple example
A $1,000 bond with a 6% coupon pays $60 yearly. If bought at $1,000, yield is 6%. If bought at $800, yield is 7.5% because $60 is 7.5% of $800.
