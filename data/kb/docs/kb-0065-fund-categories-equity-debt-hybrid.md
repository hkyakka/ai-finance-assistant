# Types of Mutual Funds: Equity, Debt, and Hybrid

**Summary:** Mutual funds are mainly classified into equity, debt, and hybrid categories. Equity funds invest in stocks and aim for growth; debt funds invest in fixed income to protect capital; hybrid funds mix both to balance risk and return.

## Key ideas
- Equity funds invest primarily in company stocks for growth potential.
- Debt funds focus on bonds and loans to provide stable income and protect capital.
- Hybrid funds combine equity and debt to balance risk and rewards.
- Equity offers higher returns but with more risk; debt is safer but often with lower returns.
- Hybrid funds suit investors wanting moderate risk and steady growth.
- Fund categorization by regulators ensures clear definitions and reduces confusion.

## Simple example
If you invest ₹10,000 in an equity fund, your money mainly buys shares of companies aiming to grow in value. A debt fund investment of ₹10,000 lends money to government or companies for fixed interest. A hybrid fund splits ₹10,000 between stocks and bonds, say ₹6,000 in equity and ₹4,000 in debt, balancing risk and returns.
