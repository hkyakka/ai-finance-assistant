# Inflation and Purchasing Power

**Summary:** Inflation means prices of goods and services go up over time. This causes the purchasing power of money to fall, meaning you can buy less with the same amount. Understanding this helps in managing finances and investments.

## Key ideas
- Purchasing power is how much goods or services money can buy.
- Inflation reduces purchasing power by making prices rise.
- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) tracks inflation and purchasing power changes.
- Central banks try to control inflation to keep money stable.
- Inflation happens due to more money supply or rising costs of goods.
- Inflation types include demand-pull, cost-push, and built-in inflation.

## Simple example
If a candy bar costs $1 today but inflation is 5% per year, next year it will cost $1.05. This means $1 buys less than before, showing reduced purchasing power.
