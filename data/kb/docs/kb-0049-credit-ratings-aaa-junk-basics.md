# Credit Ratings Basics: From AAA to Junk

**Summary:** Credit ratings show how likely a borrower will repay their debt. Ratings range from high-quality 'AAA' to risky 'junk' status below 'BB'. These ratings help investors decide how safe or risky bonds are.

## Key ideas
- AAA is the highest credit rating showing very low risk of default.
- Investment grade means a rating of BBB (S&P) or Baa (Moody’s) and above.
- Below investment grade (BB or lower) bonds are considered junk and riskier.
- Higher risk bonds pay higher interest (yield) to attract investors.
- Ratings change over time based on company financial health and debt levels.

## Simple example
A company with a BBB rating is investment grade, so its bonds are seen as relatively safe and pay 4% interest. Another company rated BB is junk grade, considered riskier, so it must offer 8% interest to attract buyers.
