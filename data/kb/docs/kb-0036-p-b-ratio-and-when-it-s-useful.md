# Understanding the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

**Summary:** The P/B ratio compares a company's stock price to its book value per share. It helps investors find undervalued companies, especially in asset-heavy industries. It's most useful when comparing companies within the same industry.

## Key ideas
- P/B ratio = Market price per share ÷ Book value per share.
- Book value = Total assets minus liabilities and intangible assets.
- A P/B ratio below 1 may indicate an undervalued stock.
- Useful for evaluating companies with many tangible assets like manufacturing or finance.
- Not as reliable for companies with large intangible assets or high debt.
- Always compare P/B ratios within the same industry for accuracy.

## Simple example
If a company’s stock trades at $40 per share and its book value per share is $50, then the P/B ratio is 0.8 ($40 ÷ $50). This can suggest the stock might be undervalued compared to its book value.
