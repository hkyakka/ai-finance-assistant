# Time Horizon and Its Importance in Investing

**Summary:** Time horizon is the length of time you plan to hold an investment to meet your financial goals. It guides how much risk you can take and helps choose suitable investments for short, medium, or long terms.

## Key ideas
- Short-term horizons are under 5 years, focusing on safer investments like savings accounts and bonds.
- Medium-term horizons last 3 to 10 years, mixing stocks and bonds to balance growth and safety.
- Long-term horizons are 10 years or more, allowing for riskier investments like stocks to benefit from growth over time.
- Longer horizons let investors handle more risk and potentially earn higher returns.
- Patience in investing reduces the chance of losses and helps grow wealth through compounding.
- Dollar-cost averaging involves investing regularly to manage market ups and downs.

## Simple example
If you plan to buy a house in 4 years, you might choose safer investments like bonds to protect your money. But if you are saving for retirement in 20 years, investing in stocks could give you higher growth despite short-term ups and downs.
