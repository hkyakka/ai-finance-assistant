# Inflation and Its Impact on Purchasing Power

**Summary:** Inflation means prices of goods and services go up over time. This causes money to lose value, reducing what you can buy with the same amount. Purchasing power shows how much your money can buy and it falls when inflation rises.

## Key ideas
- Inflation raises overall prices, decreasing money's buying power.
- Purchasing power measures the real value of money in terms of goods or services.
- Central banks use interest rates to control inflation and stabilize purchasing power.
- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) helps track changes in purchasing power.
- High inflation means prices rise fast and each dollar buys less.
- Inflation can be caused by increased money supply or supply shortages.

## Simple example
If a candy bar cost $1 last year and inflation is 5%, this year it costs $1.05. That means your $1 now buys less candy than before, showing a drop in purchasing power.
