# Market Capitalization: Large, Mid, and Small Cap Explained

**Summary:** Market capitalization is the total value of a company’s shares and helps classify companies by size. Investors use this to understand risk and growth potential. Companies are grouped into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap based on their market value.

## Key ideas
- Market cap = share price × number of shares outstanding.
- Large-cap companies usually have market caps over $10 billion and are more stable.
- Mid-cap companies range from about $2 billion to $10 billion, balancing growth and risk.
- Small-cap companies have market caps under $2 billion, often with higher growth potential but more risk.
- Market cap helps investors choose funds and assess company size beyond stock price alone.

## Simple example
If a company has 1 million shares and its stock price is $20, its market cap is $20 million (1,000,000 × $20). Based on its size, it falls into the small-cap category since it is less than $2 billion.
