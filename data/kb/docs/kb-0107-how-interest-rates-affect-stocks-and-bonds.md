# How Interest Rates Affect Stocks and Bonds

**Summary:** Interest rates influence how expensive borrowing money is, affecting both stocks and bonds. Higher rates tend to lower stock prices and bond values, while lower rates usually boost them. These changes impact consumer spending, business profits, and investment decisions.

## Key ideas
- Higher interest rates make borrowing costlier, slowing spending and growth.
- Stocks often fall when rates rise due to higher costs and lower profits.
- Bond prices drop when interest rates increase, but new bonds pay more.
- Lower interest rates encourage more borrowing, spending, and higher stock prices.
- Financial sector stocks may benefit from rising rates as they can charge more for loans.
- The Federal Reserve controls short-term rates, influencing the overall economy.

## Simple example
If the Fed raises rates from 2% to 4%, bond prices usually fall because new bonds offer higher interest. A $1,000 bond paying 2% yearly becomes less attractive, so its price may drop. At the same time, companies face higher loan costs, which can reduce stock prices.
