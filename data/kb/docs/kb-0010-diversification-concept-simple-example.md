# Diversification in Investing

**Summary:** Diversification means spreading investments across different types to reduce risk. It helps balance losses and gains, aiming for steadier returns over time.

## Key ideas
- Diversification mixes various asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate.
- It lowers risk by reducing exposure to any single investment's poor performance.
- Investing in different industries and regions helps protect against market ups and downs.
- A well-diversified portfolio often includes 25-30 different stocks or assets.
- Diversification does not eliminate all risk but helps smooth investment returns.

## Simple example
If you invest $1000, putting $400 in stocks, $300 in bonds, and $300 in real estate, a loss in one area may be balanced by gains in another, reducing your overall risk.
