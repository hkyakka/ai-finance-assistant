# How Stock Prices Move: Supply, Demand, and Expectations

**Summary:** Stock prices change mainly because of supply and demand in the market. News and investors’ expectations about a company’s future also strongly influence price movements.

## Key ideas
- Stock prices reflect the balance between buyers (demand) and sellers (supply).
- Positive news or good future expectations make more buyers willing to pay higher prices.
- Negative news or poor expectations increase sellers, pushing prices down.
- Different investors have different views, creating trades and price changes.
- Market sentiment, company earnings, and economic trends all affect stock price dynamics.

## Simple example
If a stock is priced at $50 but good news about a new CEO is released, buyers may want to buy at higher prices. Demand rises and the price may quickly increase to $55. This happens because buyers expect the company to perform better in the future.
