# Compounding: How Money Grows Over Time

**Summary:** Compounding is when interest is earned on both the original amount and the interest already added. This process helps money grow faster over time because interest builds upon itself. It works for both savings and debts, but grows your savings more quickly.

## Key ideas
- Interest is earned on the original amount plus previous interest.
- More frequent compounding (daily, monthly) means faster growth.
- The Rule of 72 estimates how long it takes to double money (72 ÷ interest rate).
- Compounding can work for investments or increase debt if unpaid.
- The formula involves principal, interest rate, compounding frequency, and time.

## Simple example
If you invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest compounded yearly, after 3 years, you will have about $1,157 because interest is added each year to the total balance, increasing future interest.
