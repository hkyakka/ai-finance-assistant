# Understanding Volatility (Standard Deviation)

**Summary:** Volatility measures how much a stock's price changes over time, showing its risk level. It is calculated using the standard deviation of returns, indicating the spread of price movements around the average.

## Key ideas
- Volatility shows the degree of price variation for a security or market.
- Higher volatility means higher risk due to bigger price swings.
- Standard deviation is the common way to measure volatility.
- Calculate daily returns first, then find their standard deviation.
- Volatility helps in pricing options and understanding market uncertainty.

## Simple example
Suppose a stock has daily returns of 1%, -0.5%, and 0.5%. The average return is (1% - 0.5% + 0.5%) / 3 = 0.33%. The deviations from average are 0.67%, -0.83%, and 0.17%. Squaring these, averaging, and taking the square root gives the standard deviation, or volatility, showing how much the returns fluctuate daily.
