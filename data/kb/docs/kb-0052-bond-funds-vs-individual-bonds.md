# Bond Funds vs Individual Bonds

**Summary:** Individual bonds are loans you hold until maturity, offering fixed interest and principal return if no default occurs. Bond funds pool many bonds, providing diversification and professional management but without a guaranteed principal amount.

## Key ideas
- Individual bonds pay steady interest and return principal at maturity if issuer doesn't default.
- Bond funds diversify across many bonds to reduce risk from any single default.
- Bond fund values fluctuate as bonds are traded actively, with no set maturity value.
- Individual bonds can have hidden costs in price spreads; bond funds charge clear expense ratios.
- Short-term individual bonds can be stable; bond funds better suit long-term diversification.
- General obligation muni bonds are safer than revenue bonds due to tax-backed payments.

## Simple example
If you buy a $1,000 individual bond paying 5% interest for 5 years, you receive $50 yearly and $1,000 back at maturity. A bond fund might invest your $1,000 across 100 bonds from different issuers, lowering risk but with varying yearly returns and no fixed maturity date.
