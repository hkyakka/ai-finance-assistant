# Common Types of Asset Classes

**Summary:** Asset classes group investments with similar features and market behavior. Main types include equities, debt, cash, gold, and real estate, each with unique risk and return profiles.

## Key ideas
- Equities (stocks) represent ownership in companies and can offer growth through price rise and dividends.
- Debt (bonds) are loans to entities that pay interest regularly and return principal at maturity.
- Cash and cash equivalents are liquid assets with low risk and low returns, like savings accounts.
- Gold and precious metals are tangible assets valued for rarity and as a hedge during market stress.
- Real estate involves ownership of land or buildings, offering rental income and potential value appreciation.
- Diversifying across asset classes helps spread risk and improves chances of positive returns.

## Simple example
If you invest $1000 by putting $400 in stocks, $300 in bonds, $100 in gold, $100 in cash, and $100 in real estate, your portfolio gains vary by asset type. Stocks may grow faster but are riskier, while bonds provide steady interest, gold protects in downturns, cash stays safe with low returns, and real estate offers income and growth.
