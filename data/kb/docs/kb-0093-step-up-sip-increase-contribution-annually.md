# Step-up SIP: Increasing Your Investment Gradually

**Summary:** Step-up SIP is a method where you increase your monthly investment amount each year. This helps your investment grow faster while matching your rising income and expenses. It’s a smart way to build a larger corpus over time.

## Key ideas
- SIP stands for Systematic Investment Plan, a fixed amount invested regularly.
- Step-up SIP means increasing your SIP amount annually by a fixed percentage.
- It helps combat inflation and matches your growing earning capacity.
- Gradually increasing investments can lead to a higher retirement corpus.
- Better suited for long-term goals like retirement or child’s education.

## Simple example
If you start with ₹5,000 per month and increase your SIP by 10% every year, next year you invest ₹5,500 monthly, and the year after ₹6,050. This steady rise boosts your investment corpus significantly over time.
