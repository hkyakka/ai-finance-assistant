# How to Read a Basic Stock Quote

**Summary:** A stock quote shows key price and volume information for a stock during a trading period. It includes the opening price, highest and lowest prices, closing price, and volume of shares traded. Understanding these helps track daily stock performance.

## Key ideas
- Open: price at the start of trading for the day.
- High: the highest price reached during the trading period.
- Low: the lowest price reached during the trading period.
- Close: the final price at market close.
- Volume: total number of shares traded during that period.
- OHLC data helps visualize stock price movements and trends.

## Simple example
For example, if a stock opens at $50, reaches a high of $55, falls to a low of $48, and closes at $53 with 1 million shares traded, these numbers summarize the day's market activity and help investors understand price changes.
