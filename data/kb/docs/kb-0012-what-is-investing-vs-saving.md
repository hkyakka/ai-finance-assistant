# Investing vs Saving: Understanding the Basics

**Summary:** Saving means putting money aside safely for short-term needs and emergencies, usually with low risk and low returns. Investing involves using money to buy assets with the goal of growing wealth over time, but it comes with higher risk and the potential for greater returns.

## Key ideas
- Saving is low risk but usually earns little interest, often not beating inflation.
- Investing carries risk but aims for higher returns over the long term.
- Saving is good for short-term goals and emergency funds.
- Investing suits goals that are years away, like retirement or education.
- Without investing, money saved may lose value due to inflation.
- Choosing to invest can significantly increase your savings over time.

## Simple example
If you save $200 monthly in a bank account, you will have $4,800 after two years, but interest earned may be low. If instead, you invest $200 monthly in a fund that grows 8% per year, after two years you could have about $5,000, showing how investing can increase your money more.
