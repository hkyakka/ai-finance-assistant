The next year, you earn interest on $1,050, so your money grows faster.

It helps balance risk and reward based on your goals, risk comfort, and how long you plan to invest.\n\n## Key ideas\n- Assets include stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, and cash.\n- Different assets behave differently over time with varying risks and returns.\n- Spreading money across asset types reduces overall investment risk.\n- Your age, goals, and risk tolerance influence how assets should be allocated.\n- Investors saving for the short term prefer safer assets like cash or bonds.\n- Long-term investors often hold more stocks to aim for higher growth.\n\n## Simple example\nIf you have $10,000 to invest, you might put $6,000 in stocks, $3,000 in bonds, and $1,000 in cash. This mix helps protect your money if stocks drop, while still aiming for growth over time.\n\n## Source\n- https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/asset-allocation-an-introduction/\n- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp"}

If the same company has EBIT of $150,000 and capital employed of $750,000, its ROCE is 20% ($150,000 ÷ $750,000).

Alternatively, if the company's earnings drop sharply, you might decide to sell earlier even if the price is below your target.\n\n## Source\n- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/when_to_sell.asp\n- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/6-methods-for-selling-stock.asp"}

Panic selling during market drops often causes unnecessary losses. Avoiding emotional decisions helps maintain long-term growth.\n\n## Key ideas\n- Chasing returns means buying assets after they have already performed well, often too late.\n- Panic selling is when investors sell quickly during market drops, locking in losses.\n- Emotions like fear and greed can harm investment decisions.\n- A long-term, patient approach usually gives better results.\n- Regularly rebalancing your portfolio helps reduce risk and avoid emotional moves.\n\n## Simple example\nIf a stock jumps 50% in one year, buying it right after may not be wise because the price could fall. For example, buying at $150 after a rise from $100 and then selling at $120 due to fear results in a loss, showing panic selling's impact.\n\n## Source\n- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/beat_the_mistakes.asp\n- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/013015/worst-mistakes-beginner-traders-make.asp"}

You pay ₹10,000 per year. If you pass away within the 20 years, your family receives ₹50 lakh. If you survive, you do not get any money back, but you had financial protection during this period.\n\n## Source\n- https://zerodha.com/varsity/are-you-mixing-insurance-and-investments-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\n- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp"}

Younger investors typically hold more stocks for growth, while older investors shift toward safer assets like bonds and cash.\n\n## Key ideas\n- Younger people usually invest more in stocks for long-term growth.\n- As you age, your portfolio becomes more conservative by adding bonds and cash.\n- A common rule is to subtract your age from 100 (or 110/120) to find the stock percentage.\n- This approach helps manage risk as retirement nears.\n- Life-cycle or target-date funds automate this age-based allocation.\n- Adjusting allocation over time aligns investments with changing goals and risk tolerance.\n\n## Simple example\nIf you are 30 years old, using the rule '100 minus age,' you would invest 70% in stocks and 30% in bonds or cash. By age 60, this shifts to 40% stocks and 60% bonds/cash to reduce risk.\n\n## Source\n- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp\n- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/rebalancing-strategies.asp"}

By comparing results at 8%, 10%, and 12%, you can understand the sensitivity of the investment to changes in the required rate of return.\n\n## Key ideas\n- Scenario analysis tests how outcomes vary with different discount rates.\n- Lower discount rates (e.g., 8%) increase present value, showing more optimistic results.\n- Higher rates (e.g., 12%) reduce present value, reflecting higher risk or cost.\n- This method helps in decision-making by visualizing possible profits or losses.\n- It highlights the impact of interest rate changes on investment value.\n- Useful for comparing project viability under various assumptions.\n\n## Simple example\nIf an investment promises $1,000 in one year, discounting at 8% gives a present value of $925.93. At 10%, it drops to $909.09, and at 12%, it reduces further to $892.86. This shows how higher discount rates lower the value today.\n\n## Source\n- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sensitivityanalysis.asp\n- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp"}

This fear can trigger panic selling when prices drop, often leading to poor financial decisions. Preparing mentally for losses helps reduce emotional reactions and promotes better trading choices.\n\n## Key ideas\n- Investors feel stronger pain from losses than pleasure from gains.\n- Fear of loss can cause premature selling, known as panic selling.\n- Overconfidence may cause underestimating the emotional impact of losses.\n- Accepting losses as normal prevents panic and impulsive trades.\n- Mental preparation and realistic risk management reduce harmful emotional responses.\n\n## Simple example\nImagine you invest $1,000 in a stock that falls to $800. Loss aversion might make you panic and sell quickly to avoid more loss. But if you accept some loss as normal and stay calm, you might hold the stock until it recovers, avoiding a premature sale.\n\n## Source\n- https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/accurate-perceptions-of-loss-and-risk-aversion/\n- https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/preparing-for-losses/"}

Understanding this bias helps avoid mistakes like panic selling or buying into bubbles.\n\n## Key ideas\n- People give too much importance to recent events, ignoring past data.\n- This bias can cause investors to expect a current trend to continue.\n- Leads to actions like panic selling during downturns or frenzy buying during booms.\n- It distorts the true chance of events happening again soon.\n- Being aware of recency bias can improve investment decision-making.\n\n## Simple example\nSuppose a stock gained 15% last month. Due to recency bias, an investor might expect the stock to gain another 15% next month, ignoring that such growth is rare and not guaranteed. If they buy more shares just based on recent gains, they risk losses if the trend reverses.\n\n## Source\n- https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/trading-biases/\n- https://www.investopedia.com/recency-availability-bias-5206686"}

A balanced confidence helps traders manage risks better.\n\n## Key ideas\n- Overconfident investors trade frequently, often with risky bets.\n- Early wins can reinforce overconfidence even if later results worsen.\n- More trades mean higher fees, reducing net profits.\n- Optimism without risk control may harm but moderate optimism can improve decision-making.\n- Inconsistent rewards encourage persistent but risky trading behavior.\n- Recognizing overconfidence helps avoid unnecessary losses.\n\n## Simple example\nIf an investor starts with $10,000 and makes 30 trades paying $10 commission each, they spend $300 on fees. Even if they earn $500 from trades, after fees their profit drops to $200. Fewer trades with the same profit would keep more earnings.\n\n## Source\n- https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/overconfidence-risk-and-rewards/\n- https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/overconfidence-the-behavioral-view/"}
